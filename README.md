# l2tabu-english

l2tabuen is the English translation of Mark Trettin's guide to LaTeX
called `l2tabu' v1.8, giving a lot of practical advice about how to
avoid the most common mistakes a user is prone to make (i.e., obsolete
commands and packages).

The package consists of these files:

- l2tabuen.tex
- l2tabuen.pdf
- README.md

It was first published [on CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/l2tabu-english) under the GNU Free Documentation License 1.2 or any later version. 

An update covering the latest release of l2tabu will follow soon.
